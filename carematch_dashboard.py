Patients submit appointment requests and complete intake forms through the organization‚Äôs digital platforms.

Although CareMatch holds a large volume of patient and operational data, it has not yet implemented advanced analytics or AI-powered tools to derive value from this information.
‚û°Ô∏è As a result, the immediate need is to **explore the data, identify opportunities, extract actionable insights, and build data-driven solutions** that can improve access, efficiency, and patient experience.

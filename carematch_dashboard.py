Patients submit appointment requests and complete intake forms through the organization’s digital platforms.

Although CareMatch holds a large volume of patient and operational data, it has not yet implemented advanced analytics or AI-powered tools to derive value from this information.
➡️ As a result, the immediate need is to **explore the data, identify opportunities, extract actionable insights, and build data-driven solutions** that can improve access, efficiency, and patient experience.

st.markdown("""
### ✅ Conclusion: Wait Time Analysis

- Wait times are fairly consistent across **language preference, provider specialty, and urgency score**.
- The **median wait time is ~15 days** for all groups, with wide variability.
- This suggests that **individual patient characteristics and provider type do not strongly impact wait times**.
- Instead, delays may be driven more by **system-level factors** such as scheduling efficiency and resource allocation.
- ⚠️ Notably, **urgency score does not significantly reduce wait times**, highlighting a **misalignment between clinical need and scheduling practices**.
